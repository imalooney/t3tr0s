;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- create state of current piece
  - :piece :J
  - :position {:x 0 :y 0}

- add color
  - change write-piece to write the piece's keyword to the board cell
  - (for coloring/texturing per piece)

- repaint when relevant state changes
  - create (drawable-board) from current piece and board

- move piece
  - ignore if piece is nil
  - key listener modifies :position
  - create try-move!

- rotate piece
  - ignore if piece is nil
  - rename functions "collide" -> "fits", and "occupied" -> "empty"
  - create try-rotate!

- hard drop
  - get-drop-pos
  - debug by drawing the ghost piece

- gravity step
  - implement as go-routine
    - wait on blink
  - drop (lower position over time)
  - lock (write piece to board if can't go any lower)
  - spawn (reset current position and randomize piece)

- row collapse
  - get-full-rows (indices)
  - blink
  - collapse full rows

;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; stats graph
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- build live graph of the game
  - x-axis = piece number
  - y-axis = height of the board after piece was dropped
  - highlight rows that were collapsed
  - shade cells above to indicate:
    - a general sense of time it took to drop the piece
    - where the piece was hard-dropped

- important to make beautiful to beckon exploration

- treat the graph as a map to be navigated
  - mouse over a column to explain the data
    - column rotates to a front view of the board (eager to show)
      - revealing that the original column was in fact a side view of the board (aha)
    - piece animates to show where it was hard-dropped

;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; multiplayer
